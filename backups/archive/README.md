# Archived Backups and Test Files

**Archived:** November 3, 2025
**Reason:** Migration to v2 completed successfully, test files no longer needed

## Archived Files

### Migration Backups
1. **index-backup-before-full-transform.html** (Nov 3, 00:05)
   - Backup before Ultra Fabric UI migration
   - Migration completed successfully
   - Kept for historical reference

2. **index-improved-reference.html** (Nov 2, 23:51)
   - Reference file during migration
   - No longer actively used

3. **telemetry-old-backup.html** (Nov 3, 02:22)
   - Old telemetry dashboard before redesign
   - New telemetry.html is working well

### Test Files
4. **test-orb.html** (Nov 2, 23:58)
   - Orb animation testing
   - Orb successfully integrated into index.html

5. **test-parser.html** (Nov 2, 23:51)
   - formatLLMResponse() function testing
   - Parser working correctly in production

6. **test-typewriter.html** (Nov 3, 00:28)

## Current Active Backups

See parent directory:
- **backups/index-*.html** - Migration snapshot backups
- **../index-before-cleanup.html** - Recent telemetry cleanup backup (Nov 3, 2025)

## Can These Be Deleted?

These files are safe to delete if:
- Current production site (index.html) is working well
- No plans to revert migration
- Disk space is needed

Otherwise, keeping them as historical reference is harmless (total: ~227KB).
